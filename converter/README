2. Instructions

To run converter: python rconvert.py [ModuleFolder] [Template File]

Module folder creates a folder from the input eg.
/home/ec2-user/Example_Folder

Template File is the rscript converted to template form.

Converter only takes one file at a time.

When prompted to overwrite, this means the module folder already exists.
Yes will continue installation of actor into the module.
This will also overwrite actor source files if the template has the same actor name in it.

To install the actors into Kepler, go to the module folder you created and type 

gradle install

Requires Kepler 2.4 to be installed with $KEPLER environment configured

The module files in KeplerData and .kepler in the home directory may need to be
deleted for modules to appear after installation.
